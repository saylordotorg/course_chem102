**Unit 3: Acids and Bases** <span id="3"></span> 
*You probably know that when you add vinegar to baking soda, you create
a wonderful foaming substance.  Some of you might have performed this
experiment in elementary school, when creating a “volcano” effect, but
we will now approach it as an example of an acid-base reaction.  In this
unit, you will learn that acid-base chemistry is highly important, as
the level of acidity or basicity in a given solution will affect the
outcome of a reaction just as much as its concentration or temperature.
 (It also gives us wonderful flashy explosions!)*
