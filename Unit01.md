**Unit 1: Rates of Reaction** <span id="1"></span> 
*As you learned last semester, Gibbs free energy will tell us whether a
reaction will occur spontaneously.  It won’t, however, tell us how long
the reaction will take from start to finish.  In this first unit, we
will learn the factors that determine the speed of a reaction.  We will
also learn about rate constants and how they affect speed.  Finally, we
will learn how to use experimental rates to figure out rate law and rate
order, which together link the rate constant to the concentration of
reactants to determine speed.*

     Instructions: Read this article, which explains how reaction rates
    are influenced by changing concentration, pressure, or temperature.
     You will also learn how reaction rates are influenced by the
    absense or presence of a catalyst.  For additional support, you may

    flashcards, a study guide, and a quiz.  This resource also covers
    sub-subunits 1.2.3 and 1.2.4.

**1.2.3 Temperature** <span id="1.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below sub-subunit
1.2.2.*

**1.2.4 Catalyst and Activation Energy** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below sub-subunit
1.2.2.  While all catalysts increase the reaction rate, it is important
to note that some catalysts are actually consumed over the course of a
reaction, though they are in the end produced again (along with the
products).  Because catalysts therefore appear in both the reactants and
the products, we remove them from the final balanced equation.  This may
give you the impression that they do not participate in the reaction—but
they actually do.  Keep this concept in mind as you take a look at
equations!*

**1.4 Reaction Mechanisms** <span id="1.4"></span> 
*Note: Though every reaction contains fast and slow steps (parts), keep
in mind that only the slow step(s) determines the rate.  If you have
more than one slow step, add them together to obtain the rate law.
 Sometimes the rate law will not include all reactants. The reactants
that are not included in the rate law are zero-order!*

     Note: In order to calculate rate law from experimental data, use
    your deductive reasoning.  Once you have looked at the data and
    isolated one reactant while keeping the others the same, see how
    changes in the concentration of that single reactant affect rate
    law.  You will quickly yield the rate law for that reactant (keep in
    mind that you may have a zero-order reactant).
