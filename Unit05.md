**Unit 5: Nuclear Chemistry** <span id="5"></span> 
*How do we know that dinosaurs are really millions of years old, or that
a particular area or object is radioactive and therefore dangerous to
human beings?  Why is radioactivity dangerous?  What is radioactivity,
exactly?  This unit will answer these questions by focusing on the
chemistry of the nucleus, and explaining how the nucleus’ inherent
instability has led us to know about radioactive dating, Geiger
counters, and even atomic fission.*

= mc<sup>2</sup>.”  The idea that energy and mass could be
interchangeable led to the invention of the atomic bomb, the most feared
weapon in the history of man.*
