**Unit 4: Electrochemistry** <span id="4"></span> 
*You may think that electricity and chemistry have little to do with
another.  However, electrochemistry enables us to use batteries—from the
AA ones you have in your remote to the lead acid versions that start our
cars.   In this unit, we will learn that electrochemistry offers us more
than just batteries, however; many electrochemical concepts—from free
energy to electron movement—apply to acid-base chemistry as well.  For
the purposes of simplification, you might think of acid-base chemistry
as “proton chemistry” and electrochemistry as “electron chemistry.”*

*Note: To remember oxidation and reduction, use the mnemonic device “OIL
RIG,” where OIL means Oxidation Is Losing (electrons) and RIG means
Reduction Is Gaining (electrons).*

**4.4 Faraday’s Constant and Electroplating** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*Note: Although it may appear complex, electroplating is really just an
electrolytic cell in disguise.  Once you understand how an electrolytic
cell works, you can use the equation that solves for the mole of
electrons transferred along with Faraday’s constant to figure out how
much metal is plated.  *
