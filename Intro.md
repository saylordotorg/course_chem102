In this second semester course, we will cover a wide-ranging field of
topics, learning everything from the equation that made Einstein famous
to why you can’t replace a dead car battery with a household battery. In
General Chemistry I ([CHEM101](/courses/chem101/)), we studied the basic
tools you need to explore different fields in chemistry, such as
stoichiometry and thermodynamics.  This second-semester course will
cover several of the tools needed to study chemistry at a more advanced
level.  We will identify the factors that affect the speed of a
reaction, learn how an atom bomb works on a chemical level, and discover
how chemistry powers a light bulb.  Topics in advanced organic and
inorganic chemistry courses will build upon what you learn in this
class.  We will end with discussion of organic chemistry, a topic that
is as important to biology as it is to chemistry.
