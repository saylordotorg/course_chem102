**Unit 2: Solutions and Chemical Equilibrium** <span id="2"></span> 
*We are now approaching the topic that most people think of when they
hear the word “chemistry,” where we pour one clear solution into another
clear solution to produce a purple solution, or add a pink solution to
an orange solution to make a clear solution.  Though these
transformations may seem like a magic trick, they actually depend on the
properties of solution chemistry, solubility, and chemical
equilibrium—all of which will be discussed in this unit.*

**2.1.2 Reaction Quotient and Equilibrium Constant** <span
id="2.1.2"></span> 
*Note: When reaction quotient Q is equal to K, we have equilibrium.  If
Q is less than K, the reaction favors products.  The contrary is true
when Q is greater than K.*

chemistry nearly always uses molarity (measured in liters), while

**2.2.3 Periodic Rules of Solubility** <span id="2.2.3"></span> 
Note: There are certain rules of solubility that you must commit to
memory.  For example, you should memorize the fact that all nitrates and
potassium compounds are soluble.  You should also know the insoluble
products (like lead sulfate, calcium carbonate, and silver iodide) that
most commonly show up in chemistry problems.  Remember those period
rules!

one compound but insoluble as part of another.  This means that the
common ion can never be an ion that is always soluble.*
