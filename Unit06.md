**Unit 6: Organic Chemistry** <span id="6"></span> 
*Although we have devoted an entire separate course (CHEM103: Organic
Chemistry) in the chemistry discipline to the subject of organic
chemistry, some of its simplest and most fundamental topics will be
introduced in this course as well.  If you plan to continue studying
chemistry, biology, or even physics, a basic understanding of organic
chemistry is essential.  Organic chemistry combines knowledge from all
three fields; the lessons you learn in this course directly apply to the
way our bodies function and are therefore crucial to your career as a
biologist.*

**6.1 Properties of Carbon** <span id="6.1"></span> 
*Note: Organic chemistry is perhaps more aptly described as “carbon
chemistry,” since all organic properties deal with carbon.  You should
pay special attention to the unique properties of this element and
appreciate that when we say living things are carbon-based life forms,
we really mean it!*

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this article, which explains carbon at the
    atomic level and how diverse it is physically and chemically.
     Examine the bonding and atomic arrangement of carbon.  For
    additional support, you may visit the original Boundless page which
    contains supplementary flashcards, a study guide, and a quiz.

**6.2 Major Functional Groups** <span id="6.2"></span> 
**6.2.1 Hydrocarbons** <span id="6.2.1"></span> 
**Note: Coal, natural gas, and petroleum are all forms of hydrocarbons.
 They are the main source of fuel in the modern world.  Understanding
the energy contained in these carbon-to-carbon bonds is the key to
understanding why they are so important to our society.  **

**6.2.3 Organic Acids** <span id="6.2.3"></span> 
*Note: Most organic acids are not strong acids.  As such, most of them
have pKa values instead of direct pH values.  Organic acids can also act
as a great buffer system depending on their conjugate bases; they in
part explain how our bodies adjust to changes in pH.*

**6.2.4 Amines** <span id="6.2.4"></span> 
*Note: Amines contain nitrogen, a vital element in our bodies.  Remember
the Atkins diet, which suggests that eating more protein and less
carbohydrates will lead to rapid weight loss?  The diet is based upon
the idea that eating more protein means ingesting more amines, and our
bodies process amines differently than they do carbohydrates.*

**6.3.2 Oxidation-Reduction** <span id="6.3.2"></span> 
*Note: In this context, oxidation does not mean “losing electrons” so
much as “gaining oxygen atoms” (although the molecule undergoing
oxidation in organic chemistry will lose electrons in the process).
 Meanwhile, “reduction” in organic chemistry refers to the gaining of
hydrogen atoms (note that the molecule will gain electrons in the
process as well).*
